2. Users can add their texts, photos to any desired sites. Therefore, the other users can also see these pages.

**Features**
1. Provide sign up and login functions to save user data.
2. Visualize different sites on Google Maps.
3. Display and filter various information of heritage sites.
4. Save and post user reviews and update the database accordingly.
5. Display heritage site map or list based on the query.

- Add Users page with userList and UserItem components to store user data, including name, e-mail, password and images. A read-only review is presented for users who are logged out. After log in, user will be able to update their collection of various sites.
- Google Maps API is introduced in single site view. Custom form input component is added for authenticated users to edit site information.
- Add UserPlaces page for authorized users to access their individual database, and perform CRUD operations on heritage sites of interest.
- Add Place and Update Place pages are added for user to add selected heritage site.
- Note: It is better to build the UI and then user `"start": "serve -s build"` to serve the static files instead to run `react-scripts start` on Heroku.

## Iteration 1
**Contribution**
* Yiwen Fang: API, database, and CRUD schema/method.
* Dong Liu: UI, routing, and link.
* Peng Hao: UI, routing, and link.

### API Update
* Build REST API as backend API server by Node.js and Express. Add routing and relative routes. ESLint is used to make up JavaScript code. Note: `|| exit 0` in `"lint": "eslint . || exit 0"` is used to hide the exit status which is not important.
* Handle errors for http requests by creating HttpError class inherited from Error. Http requests are tested by Postman.
* Add controllers to make `xxx-routes.js` files more organized.
* Add POST routes to create comment and user. `uuid` is used to create a unique uid for the user.
* Add PATCH routes to update and DELETE routes to delete.
* Add validations for request bodies by using `express-validator`.
* Routing, links, and the basis of a CRUD schema (based on Mongoose) are established. MongoDB is used as the database to store three collections `places`, `comments`, and `users`. Mongoose is used to operate the database. The schemas and models are created. `mongoose-unique-validator` is used to help the validation where necessary.
* MongoDB Atlas is used to as the cloud database. A local hosted database is also setup for development. The backend is connected with MongoDB. Some scripts in the `scripts` folder are used to populate dummy data (e.g., Mockaroo) for testing. Note: The transaction related code in `users-controllers.js` works well for cloud MongoDB, but not for the local database. (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-nodejs-express-mongodb-the-mern-fullstack-guide/learn/lecture/16929028#questions/8687580) Comment out code parts when using local database at the development stage. However, is will be OK after deploying to the cloud.
* The CRUD module containing the main functionality is added. The `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` methods work well to make any queries or mutations. The screenshots to show part of backend API links and HTTP methods from Postman are shown below.

Iterations

Iteration 1

![page 1](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/NEU-CS5610-SU20/GroupProject_ThreeMusketeers_UI/blob/master/src/images/screenshot-page1.png)

![page 2](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/NEU-CS5610-SU20/GroupProject_ThreeMusketeers_UI/blob/master/src/images/screenshot-page2.png)

- For iteration 1, a boilerplate was first created by npx react-create-app. Front-end components are added under src/components folder, which comprise of both functional and class components depending on the requirement for state change. A separate src/pages folder includes three internal pages for the project.
- A Google Maps API is included in the home page, more specific functions and synchronization with backend database are yet to be implemented during next phase of the project.
- React-router component is used for navigating internally in the website.
- Reference: css stylesheet adapted from : https://github.com/john-smilga/setup-files-react-beach-resort

Iteration 2 To Dos:
- Add login and logout components and functionalities through Google authentication similar to the approach given in the MERN Stack book.
- On page 1(home page), connect UNESCO geographic data with embedded Google Maps API, which displays the location pins of various world heritage sites, add search and filter options for user to narrow the map scope.
- On page 2 (view select sites), provide comments and bookmark functions for user who logs into the website, and synchronize data with backend database.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
